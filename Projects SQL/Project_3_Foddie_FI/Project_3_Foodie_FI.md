</p>

## Context of the case Study 
We are in front of a new start-up based on subscription services just alike Netflix or Disney + this start-up also known as foodie-fi is a bussiness of food streaming and content related to food and its types .

Our customer (foodie-fi) has given to us a dataset about the subscriptions to get some insights about the bussiness and how can it grow with the results of this data analysis.

## Dataset 
The schema is named foodie_fi and contains two tables with information about the costumers an their subscription plans . 

1. **foodie_fi.plans** : This table contains all the plans in the bussiness and it has three columns : plan_id , plan_name and prince . 
```SQL 
SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.plans
``` 
| plan_id | plan_name     | price  |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| 0       | trial         | 0.00   |
| 1       | basic monthly | 9.90   |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 19.90  |
| 3       | pro annual    | 199.00 |
| 4       | churn         | null   |

2. **foodie_fi.subscriptions** : This table contains all the information about the customer subscription and has columns like customer_id,plan_id_start_date . 

```SQL 
SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
LIMIT 5 ; 
```
| customer_id | plan_id | start_date               |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------|
| 1           | 0       | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z |
| 1           | 1       | 2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z |
| 2           | 0       | 2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z |
| 2           | 3       | 2020-09-27T00:00:00.000Z |
| 3           | 0       | 2020-01-13T00:00:00.000Z |

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The ERD helps us to understand the links between the tables and how could we implement the join .

## Customer Questions 


### **A. Customer Journey**

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
```SQL 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS foodie_start ;
CREATE TEMP TABLE foodie_start  AS 
SELECT 
s.customer_id ,
s.start_date,
s.plan_id,
p.plan_name,
p.price 
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s 
FULL JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p 
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id ; 

SELECT *
FROM foodie_start ; 
```
```
When a potential customer is interested in the bussiness decide take a trial plan to get a first look of the product then if he is still interested in the product he should pay for a subscription for a period of time monthly anual etc and this plan has a price , once a customer are subscribed in a trial plan or other .  he will get a customer_id and the start date of the plan , if he continue with the service this plan and price will change but the customer id remain the same . 
```


### **B. Data Analysis Questions**

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
```SQL

```SQL
WITH date_distribution AS (
SELECT
DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date::DATE) AS start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
SELECT 
start_date,
COUNT(*)
FROM date_distribution
GROUP BY start_date 
ORDER BY start_date;
```

; 

SELECT COUNT(*)

plan_id
FROM foodie_start 
WHERE plan_id = 3
)
SELECT 
--ap.customer_id,
--ap.start_date AS annual_plan_date,
--t.start_date AS trial_date
CEILING(AVG(DATE_PART('days',ap.start_date::TIMESTAMP - t.start_date::TIMESTAMP)))
FROM annual_plan as ap
INNER JOIN trials as t
ON ap.customer_id = t.customer_id
```
10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
```SQL
WITH annual_plan AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    start_date
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 3
),
trial AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    start_date
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 0
),
annual_days AS (
SELECT
  DATE_PART(
      'days',
      annual_plan.start_date::TIMESTAMP -
        trial.start_date::TIMESTAMP
    )::INTEGER AS duration
FROM annual_plan
INNER JOIN trial
  ON annual_plan.customer_id = trial.customer_id
),COUNTS AS (
SELECT
 (30* (annual_days.duration / 30) || ' - ' || ((30 * (annual_days.duration / 30))+30 )|| ' days')::TEXT AS breakdown_period,
  COUNT(*)AS customers
FROM annual_days
GROUP BY breakdown_period,annual_days.duration
ORDER BY annual_days.duration)

SELECT breakdown_period , SUM(customers) AS customers

```
11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

  start_date,
  LAG(plan_id) OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY start_date
  ) AS lag_plan_id
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE DATE_PART('year', start_date) = 2020
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM ranked_plans
WHERE lag_plan_id = 1 AND plan_id = 2;
```
### **C. Challenge Payment Question**

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* Monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan

* Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately

* Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period

* Once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
```SQL
