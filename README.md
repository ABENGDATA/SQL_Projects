This is a SQL course oriented to data self-taught coders , this course covers from basic to complex queries 
using datetime , string manipulation and window functions , also this is a very good experience to learn a 
languange by doing projects .
I want to bring this experience to my portfolio because there are not exist a more complete course of SQL like this 
and his examples and projects are known as real world problems by other data scientists in the social media .

## Table of contents 🕹
## **SQL projects** 

In this section we will see the eight projects that this course suggest and all the queries and functions
required to solve the questions that were proposed.

### Project : Dannys Diner

</p>

In this project you'll see how we can do a basic analysis with SQL in a small database and generate complex queries with few data and get useful results , Our study case is named "Dannys Dinner" a food shop that wants to use its informations in a way that can be used for get the bussiness better .

This project was about the analysis of a start-up of pizza , several queries were generated to accomplish the questions of the customer (owner of the start-up) , if you check our work you can realize that it was an exploratory work through SQL code .

## **Concept review (spanish only)** : 
This section covers the theory behind this course , In fact I only covered those topics that I consider important in a data analysis process in SQL .
