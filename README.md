# Serious SQL Course by Danny Ma ðŸ•¹
This is a SQL course oriented to data self-taught coders , this course covers from basic to complex queries 
using datetime , string manipulation and window functions , also this is a very good experience to learn a 
languange by doing projects .

I want to bring this experience to my portfolio because there are not exist a more complete course of SQL like this 
and his examples and projects are known as real world problems by other data scientists in the social media .

## Table of contents ðŸ•¹
**SQL projects** : In this section we will see the eight projects that this course suggest and all the queries and functions
required to solve the questions that were proposed.

**Concept review (spanish only)** : This section covers the theory behind this course , In fact I only covered those topics 
that I consider important in a data analysis process in SQL .
