# Serious SQL Course by Danny Ma ðŸ•¹
This is a SQL course oriented to data self-taught coders , this course covers from basic to complex queries 
using datetime , string manipulation and window functions , also this is a very good experience to learn a 
languange by doing projects .

and his examples and projects are known as real world problems by other data scientists in the social media .
